## HTML 
HTML entities are special codes used in 
HTML to represent characters that are either reserved in HTML or not easily typed on a keyboard. 
They ensure that the characters display correctly in a web browser
They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;)

# Reserved Characters:
Some characters have special meanings in HTML. For example, the less-than sign < is used to start a tag. 
To display a < in your content, you need to use an HTML entity so the browser knows you mean the character itself, not the start of a tag.

## Non-Keyboard Characters: 
There are characters that you might not find on your keyboard, like special symbols (©, ™) or accented letters (é, ñ). 
HTML entities allow you to include these characters in your web pages

##How to Use HTML Entities
Syntax: HTML entities start with & and end with ;. For example:

< becomes &lt;
> becomes &gt;
& becomes &amp;
© becomes &copy;
é becomes &eacute;

##The quotation tag in HTML is used to display quotations. 
There are two main tags for this purpose: <blockquote> and <q>.
##1. <blockquote> Tag
The <blockquote> tag is used for longer quotes or block-level quotations
##2. <q> Tag
The <q> tag is used for shorter, inline quotations. It typically surrounds the quoted text with quotation marks

##When to Use Them
<blockquote>: Use this tag for longer passages or when you want the quote to stand out on its own.
<q>: Use this tag for shorter quotes that are part of a sentence.
